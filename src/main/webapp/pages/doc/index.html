        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Forewords :</b> JarialTekin is intended to be a simple and extensible
            tasks and projects manager.<br/>
            It is composed of a front-end part (the UI) and a back-end API
            (JarialTekin API) currently implemented with Java (1.8).

        <p>
            JarialTekin API is a server side application that implements a GraphQL API
            for the JarialTekin progressive web app (PWA).<br/>
            Its first goal is to provide an interface to access and manipulate data in
            database (CRUD operations).<br/>
            However, further developments will probably extend the funcntionalities of
            this application to include the ability to perform more complex processing.
