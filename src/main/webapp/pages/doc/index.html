        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Forewords :</b> JarialTekin is intended to be a simple and extensible
            tasks and projects manager.<br/>
            It is composed of a front-end part (the UI) and a back-end API
            (JarialTekin API) currently implemented with Java (1.8).
        </p>

        <p>
            JarialTekin API is a server side application that implements a GraphQL API
            for the JarialTekin progressive web app (PWA).<br/>
            Its first goal is to provide an interface to access and manipulate data in
            database (CRUD operations).<br/>
            However, further developments will probably extend the funcntionalities of
            this application to include the ability to perform more complex processing.<br/>

        <h2>Application Structure</h2>
        <p>
            JarialTekin API has a 'layer-based' structure that is represented on the
            schema below.

            <b class="underlined">Description :</b><br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Endpoint :</b> all requests from the front-end (jarialtekin-app) hit the
                    GraphQL endpoint (class <i>fr.devnr.jarialtekinapi.graphql.GraphQLEndpoint</i>).
                    It play the role of the application entrypoint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Resolvers :</b> resolvers are used to map GraphQL requests to Java objects.
                    They manipulate only DTO objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Services :</b> services contains the core of the application. First, they
                    serve as kind of serialization/deserialization interface between DTO and Model
                    objects. Furthermore they can perform some specific processing with DTO and
                    Model objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>DAOs (Data Access Objects) :</b> DAOs are used to extract Model ojects from the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>DTOs (Data Transfer Objetcs) :</b> DTOs are intended to map GraphQL schema types.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Models (Model objects) :</b> Models are intended to map tables from the database schema.
                </li>
